## Coffee Orders Dashboard (Excel Project)

This project presents a dynamic and interactive dashboard built in Microsoft Excel, using a dataset of coffee orders. It was designed as a personal learning exercise to strengthen my Excel data analysis and visualization skills, while working with real-world-style data.

Through this project, I explored techniques for cleaning and organizing data, building pivot tables and pivot charts, and designing dashboards that are both informative and user-friendly.
